# AOC Typescript

This is a repository for my Advent of Code solutions in Typescript.

Advent of Code is a yearly event where you solve programming puzzles. You can find more information [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Pre-requisites

To run the solutions, you need to have node-ts installed. To set up the project, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the solutions

I am using node-ts to run the solutions. To run a solution, use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node 2024/day1.ts
```

## Getting the input

To get the input for a day, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node getInput.ts 2024 1
```

This will create a file `2024/day1-input.txt` with the input for day 1.
